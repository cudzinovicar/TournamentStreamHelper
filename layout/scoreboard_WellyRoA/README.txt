Use the 'online' .html files when streaming online tournaments, or any other case where there are in-game elements at the top of the screen (i.e. the in-game scoreboard).
These versions have a solid background behind the tags to hide that. 

If you wish to use the character artworks instead of the 3D renders for RoA2, edit 'settings.json' and change "costume" to "art".
